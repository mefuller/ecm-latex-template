# (2021) European Combustion Meeting LaTeX Template

This repository contains the (unofficial) LaTeX template for the
European Sections of the Combustion Institute (ESCI).
This repository is a fork of the USSCI template developed by Bryan W. Weber and Kyle E. Niemeyer.
The source for the original template can be found online at https://github.com/pr-omethe-us/ussci-latex-template
This fork for the ECM/ESCI is hosted at https://github.com/mefuller/ecm-latex-template

## Instructions

1. Download a zip file of this repository and extract it
2. Open and try to build the `template.tex` file to make sure that everything works properly
3. If your references don't end up as numbers, make sure that your TeX environment/editor is set to use biber to compile the references. By default, most editors (such as TeXStudio) default to using BibTeX.
4. Copy the `template.tex` file and edit it to add your paper content
